## Overview  
This repository contains the data, documentation, tables, images, and code associated with the article *Pop Goes Profanity* (JLPC). Its purpose is to make available the materials needed to reproduce the analyses, explore the supplementary Tables/Figures, and provide transparency of the study.

Here is a brief overview of the folder structure and contents:

### Folder structure and contents  
- **`data/`**  
  Contains the raw and/or processed datasets used in the analyses. Use these files as the starting point for reproducing the tables/figures reported in the article.

- **`docs/`**  
  Includes documentation, codebooks, and any further explanatory materials (e.g., method explanations) that support the main article.

- **`images/`**  
  Contains the graphical figures produced for the article: plots, charts, and other image files (PNG, JPEG) generated by the analysis.

- **`tables/`**  
  Contains tabular output: text files (e.g., `.txt`, `.csv`) of summary tables, regression result tables, frequency tables, etc., as referred to in the article.

- **`PopGoesProfanity_JLPC_Part1.qmd`**  
  A Quarto Markdown file (or RMarkdown) containing the main analysis script or reproducible document linking code, tables, and figures.

- **`PopGoesProfanity_JLPC.Rproj`**  
  The RStudio project file to facilitate working in the same environment.

## How to use this repository  
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.  
2. Open the RStudio project file `PopGoesProfanity_JLPC.Rproj`.  
3. Inspect the documentation under `docs/`, especially if you want to understand variable definitions, data transformations, or analytic steps.  
4. Use the datasets in `data/` to rerun the analyses. For ease, you may start with the script in `PopGoesProfanity_JLPC_Part1.qmd`.  
5. After running the code, check that you obtain the same output files (tables in `tables/`, figures in `images/`) as those provided.  
6. Use or adapt the tables and images in your own work (slides, lectures) while properly citing the associated article and this repository.

## Contents in more detail  
### `data/`  
- Contains files like `dat.csv`, `vtypes.txt`, etc.  
- These include the full dataset used for analysis with variables such as `no_words`, `total_bad_word_count`, `assigned_topic`, `vulgarity_level`, etc.  
- The data are cleaned and structured as described in the article’s Methods section.

### `docs/`  
- Codebook describing each variable used.  
- Explanation of how vulgar words were identified, how topics were assigned, and other methodological decisions.  
- Links between the article’s tables/figures and files in this repository.

### `images/`  
- Figures such as:  
  - *Fig0.png*: time-series of relative frequency of vulgar elements per 1,000 words (overall).  
  - *Fig1.png*: time-series by genre.  
  - *Fig2.png*: percentage of songs with vulgarity over time.  
  - *Fig3.png*: relative frequency of lemma in corpus.  
  - *Fig4.png*: frequency by gender.  
  - *Fig5.png*: time-series by topic.  
  - *Fig6.png*: trends of vulgarity levels.  

### `tables/`  
- Tabular files such as:  
  - `table01.txt`: summary by year_chart (songs, words, vulgar words, etc.).  
  - `table02.txt`: summary by assigned_topic.  
  - `vtypes.txt`: summary of vulgar lemmas (frequency, relative frequency).  
  - `lowtypes.txt`: lower-frequency lemma summary.  

### `PopGoesProfanity_JLPC_Part1.qmd`  
- Main analysis document (Quarto Markdown).  
- Running this file will generate many of the tables and figures automatically.  
- Use as a template for rerunning or extending the analysis.

---

## Reproducibility / Dependencies  
- Analyses performed in R.  
- Required packages include: `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, `forcats`, `here`, `stats`, etc.  
- Use the same or similar R version and package versions as specified in the Quarto document.  
- Run the code in sequence to reproduce tables and figures.
